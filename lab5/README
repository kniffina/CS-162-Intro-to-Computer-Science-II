Description: This is the README file for lab5 cs 199. It contains compilation instructions

Instructions for compilation: The programs have been added to a makefile named "prog". In order for the compilation to occur type make all, followed by prog. This will compile all of the programs together. To
 "clean" the files, type "clean all". 


***  3 Things I found difficult about this lab  ***

1) The biggest issue I had with the lab was using the correct constructors. At first I was not totally sure how to initialize the member variables if they were inherited but was able to find my errors and make the correct adjustments.

2) Using srand properly. I was not getting random numbers for awhile and I found out that it was because I had srand multiple times and it was causing some sort of error.

3)Figuring out a way to loop with all of the given conditions. It was difficult to find a way to continue the loop when your attacks were at 0 but you still wanted to add some if statement to see if more attacks would be done.

***  3 Things I learned from this lab  ***

1) I have used boolean flags before but I felt that it was extremely helpful in this specific lab. When first creating my while loop I had a bunch of requirements to make it stop, but I then used a single boolean variable and once all those conditions were met in my loop, I would simply make it true, to stop looping.

2) I learned more about inheritance and in particular, abstract classes. At first I was not sure if abstract classes needed a cpp file, or really, what they were there for. After doing the lab I can now see exactly what their purpose is and how they are useful for writing programs.

3)I also learned how to create pointer to objects of the parent class so that all child classes can be accessed. I had this problem many times in other classes and always wondered what a particular answer to the problem was, now I have one.
